#UnoPico examples
Each folder is an example how to leverage unopico's platform. Kitchen sink is a good place to start as it has all of the modules available.
*Please note* that due to browser security restriction, you have to run each folder inside a webserver. 
To do so, open command line and go into the folder of your app:
- Python 2: `python -m http.server` 
- Python 3:`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- PHP: `php -S localhost:8000`

then open http://localhost:8000
